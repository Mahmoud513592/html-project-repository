1)Procedural Programming Language: The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result. Typically,
this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements, which separates them from functional programming languages.
Functions of procedural language may control variables, other than function’s  value  returns. For example, printing out information.
<br/>
2)Functional Programming Language: Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive 
functions.The functional programing’s  primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different suggests that storing state
are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify
or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and
build it easier to figure on abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult
to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).
<br/>
3)Object-oriented Programming Language: This programming language  views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external 
accessing parts of that data. The aim this programming language  is to think about the fault by separating it into a collection of objects that offer
services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language  is encapsulation that 
everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread
current implementations without having to change a great deal of code by using polymorphism.
<br/>
4)Scripting Programming Language: These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall
into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with support for development of large systems. For example, they
may not have compile-time type checking. Usually, these languages require tiny syntax to get started.
<br/>
5)Logic Programming Language: These types of languages let programmers  make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the 
consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do something, but employing restrictions on what it must
consider doing.
